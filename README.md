# Gaussian-Naive-Bayes
Obtained some machine learning data for classification, test various SKLearn implementations of Naïve Bayes, and reported your findings.

This is a python program where we are loading the dataset using sklearn dataset library. Then we split those data in training and testing data for each run after which we pass these data to Gaussian Naïve Bayes Classifier to label this data. Lastly, we return the results of how well the Classifier performed by printing number of mislabeled points, average number of correct and incorrect predictions/probabilities to label the testing data
